[X] get space-shooter back to working order by making it possible to setup textures before game starts
[X] need the ability to create containers/surfaces that are display layers
[X] setup a system that understands render order for what is visible on screen
[X] setup a render layer system
[X] engine should have inputs like batching process
[X] dynamically add quads to buffer
[ ] dyanically remove quads from buffer
[X] re-integrate new renderer into game engine
[ ] re-integrate texture rendering 
[ ] camera - zoom, pan, rotate
  [X] Zoom
  [X] pan
  [X] rotate
[ ] job scheduling, Service Workers
[ ] culling
[ ] need the ability to draw lines, circles
  [X] lines
  [ ] circles

[ ] rect needs methods for copy, global and local coordinates (top left)
[ ] need a layout engine that works like div-image era web dev
[ ] maybe use texture loading as a setup screen
[ ] setup observable modal system for event notifications

Ideas:
Entities
  - have a GUID (Globally Unique ID)
  - have no data or methods
Components
  - have no behavrior
  - they have data/state
Systems
  - have no state
  - methods for acting upon Components should all live inside the Systems
  - System essentially provides the method-implementation for Components

  ```
  class GenericEntity {
    pos = new PosComponent()
    agility = new AgilityComponent()
  }
  class PosComponent {
    x: number
    y: number
  }
  System {
    updatePos(pos: PosComponet) {
      pos.x ++;
    }
  }
  ```

Want to limit the size of the mental model you need to think about code

# thoughts about technology progression
- technology trickles down from war?
- technology trickles down from food?
- technology trickles down from art?
- animal skin -> wood -> stone -> bronze -> iron -> modern
- nomadic sheperds -> sheperds w/ agriculture -> institutionalized food


I think a good idea is to use the "AI Behavior Tree" of a character and treat it as it's "DNA" that represents their "person".

The DNA updates quickly as a child via some sort of NEAT variant + GA

This creates a nature v nurture reality for the character as half of who the character is determined
by their parents and half determined by their early life.

It can triggering an epigenitc response (DNA change) during a traumatic experience 

As an adult it mostly stays the same

All characters are subject to medling by evil spirits that can never infect more than 95% of the population... not sure how this works
